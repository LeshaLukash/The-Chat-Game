I've got some small key and some kind of pager.
Watcher, 18:56, 0, 0
Don't tell what you've just got!
Watcher, 18:57, 0, 0
Yes, it is a slightly modified pager. When you push its button, all others participant's pagers will receive a notification. Don't push anything now.
Watcher, 18:57, 0, 0
This pager is one of the most important part of our game. Here are one really important rule:
Watcher, 18:58, 0, 0
When any of you reach the target, you MUST press the button on your device. Thus, that will notify other players that current stage has completed.
Watcher, 18:58, 0, 0
The items that you got, together will allow you to get the prize.
BigMayfield, 19:00, 0, 0

BigMayfield, 19:00, 0, 0
what do we have to do exactly?
Watcher, 19:02, 0, 0
When the game will begin and I declare one of you as a target, all other participants must reach them as fast as possible and take the key item from them. Target must not leave their house. Use any means to obtain the key item.
BigMayfield, 19:03, 0, 0

Do as you wish.

Watcher, 20:05, 0, 0
Now we will wait until all participants return to their places, because the last target was further away from everyone else. Until then we are adjourned.
saxxxy13, 20:06, 0, 1
yeah, while they're on their way back, I can make it to James and return home.
Watcher, 22:00, 0, 0

Watcher, 22:41, 0, 0
Absolutely right! Passions are running high!

saxxxy13, 22:43, 0, 1
I've just realized that if James made it to Maria and Ashley didn't, it means that it would take Ashley as long to get to me as it took James to get to Maria
leyfin, 22:44, 1, 0
it will take him as long to get to you as it will take me to get to Maria)
Watcher, 22:45, 0, 0
Dear participants, I am glad to anounce the next target!
Watcher, 22:45, 0, 0
Your target: saxxxy13, who lives on 41 Craig Street. The item you are looking is a small box with a cutout for a candle.
Watcher, 22:45, 0, 0
Who will get him first? James from 14 Bahman or Ashley from Phinea 34?
saxxxy13, 22:45, 0, 1
I knew it
Watcher, 23:21, 0, 0
Excellent work! I guess, the remaining participant knows what it means.
